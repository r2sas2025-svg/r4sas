# R as a Calculator
```{r}
1 + 1
3 * (4 + 5)
```

# Objects & Assignment
```{r}
x <- 10
y <- 3.5
x + y
```

# Getting Help
```{r}
?mean
help("lm")
```

# Working Directory
```{r}
getwd()
# setwd("/path/you/want") # avoid in reproducible code; prefer here::here() for projects
```

# Vectors (Atomic)
```{r}
nums <- c(1, 2, 3, 4)
chars <- c("a", "b", "c")
logical <- c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE)
typeof(nums); typeof(chars); typeof(logical)
```

# Exercises
1. Create an object `z` that stores `(5^2 + 7)/3`.
2. Use `?seq` and create a sequence from 0 to 1 by 0.1.
3. Inspect `typeof()` for a few objects you create.
