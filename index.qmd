# About this Course

This Course from **R beginner** to **expert**, with a practical focus on **clinical programming** (CDISC/ADaM and TLFs).  
Each chapter includes step-by-step explanations, runnable code, and short exercises.

## How to Use
1. Install: R (â‰¥4.2), RStudio (or VS Code).
2. Follow along chapter-by-chapter, running code and completing exercises.
3. Use sample data or your own clinical trial datasets (SAS/CSV).
## Structure (Highlights)
- **Basics & Data**: R syntax, data types/structures, vectors/data frames/lists.
- **I/O**: Read SAS datasets (with `haven`), handle labels, and clean raw data.
- **Programming**: Base functions, write your own functions, validate with tests.
- **DevOps**: Create an R package, connect Git in RStudio/GitHub.
- **CDISC**: Build ADaM (ADSL) from SDTM-like inputs.
- **TLFs**: Produce a baseline Table 1, a KM plot, and a listing.

> Tip: If you don't have sample SDTM/ADaM data yet, the chapters generate **small synthetic data** as a fallback so everything runs end-to-end.
